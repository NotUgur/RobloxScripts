Laundry Simulator Script is published and anyone can use it but doesnt working properly since I didnt got time to finish it, I will finish it whenever.


All of the Scripts are tested on the following executors:

Solara: Working fully.
Xeno: Working fully.
Delta Mobile: Working fully but esp is buggy due to mobile graphics of the game.


TODO:

-- Finish Laundry Simulator Script.
-- Make autofarm script to the Goal Kick Simulator.
-- Make autofarm script to the Training Simulator.
-- Make autofarm script to the GYM Star Simulator.
-- Make autofarm script to the Tug of War Simuator.
-- Make an universal ESP and Aimbot script that bypasses many anticheat.
-- Make an Loader to the script to access all of the scripts in just one script, and set-up autoexec feature for it.
